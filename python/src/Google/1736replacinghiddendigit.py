LeetCode 1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits

Problem Statement:
You are given a string time in the form of hh:mm, where some of the digits in the string are hidden
(represented by ?). The valid times are those inclusively between 00:00 and 23:59.
Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.

Time Complexity: O(1) as we process a fixed length string
Space Complexity: O(1) as we use constant extra space
