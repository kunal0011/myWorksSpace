LeetCode 1422: Maximum Score After Splitting a String

Problem Statement:
Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings.
The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

Logic:
1. Basic Solution (O(nÂ²)):
   - Try each possible split position
   - Count zeros in left part and ones in right part
   - Keep track of maximum score

2. Optimized Solution (O(n)):
   - First count total ones in string
   - Iterate through string once:
     * Keep track of zeros on left
     * Calculate ones on right by subtracting ones seen so far from total ones
     * Update max score if current split is better
   
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
