LeetCode 425: Word Squares

Problem Statement:
Given an array of unique strings words, return all the word squares you can build from words.
A sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact 
same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numCols).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because 
each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y

Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 5
- All words[i] have the same length
- words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters
- All words[i] are unique

Solution Logic Explanation:

1. Trie-based Approach:
   - Build a trie to efficiently find words with given prefixes
   - Store word indices at each node for quick lookup
   - Each node maintains list of all words that share the prefix

2. Backtracking Strategy:
   - Start with each word as first word in square
   - For each subsequent position:
     * Calculate required prefix from existing words
     * Find all words with that prefix using trie
     * Try each candidate and backtrack

3. Key Optimizations:
   - Use trie for O(L) prefix lookups where L is word length
   - Store word indices instead of full words in trie
   - Early termination when no words match required prefix

Time Complexity: O(N*L) for trie construction + O(N*26^L) for backtracking
where N is number of words and L is word length
Space Complexity: O(N*L) for trie storage
