LeetCode 135. Candy

Problem Statement:
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in an integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:
- n == ratings.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
