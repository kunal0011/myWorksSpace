LeetCode 157. Read N Characters Given Read4

Problem Statement:
Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, 
implement a method to read n characters.

Method read4:
The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters 
into the buffer array buf4.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].

Method read:
By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from file 
and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate file directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Example 1:
Input: file = "abc", n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". 
We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.

Example 2:
Input: file = "abcde", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". 
We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

Constraints:
- 1 <= file.length <= 500
- file consists of English letters and digits
- 1 <= n <= 1000
