LeetCode 904: Fruit Into Baskets

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right.
The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. 
- Starting from any tree, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree while moving to the right.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Return the maximum number of fruits you can collect using these rules.

Constraints:
- 1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length
