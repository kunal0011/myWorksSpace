LeetCode 89. Gray Code

Problem Statement:
An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers where:
- Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2^n - 1]
- The first integer is 0
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit

Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 16
