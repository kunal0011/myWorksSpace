LeetCode 38. Count and Say

Problem Statement:
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), 
  which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into minimal groups of the same digit. 
Then for each group, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"

Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "1211"

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30
