LeetCode 403: Frog Jump

Problem Statement:
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. 
The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by 
landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.
The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Example 1:
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping:
1 unit to stone 1, then 2 units to stone 3, then 2 units to stone 5, then 3 units to stone 8, 
then 4 units to stone 12, then 5 units to stone 17.

Time Complexity: O(n * k) where n is number of stones and k is max jump size
Space Complexity: O(n * k) for the dp dictionary storing jump sizes at each stone
