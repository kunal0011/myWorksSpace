LeetCode 127. Word Ladder

Problem Statement:
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence
of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k must be in wordList
- Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList
- sk == endWord

Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, return the number of words in
the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, so no transformation sequence exists.

Constraints:
- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in wordList are unique
