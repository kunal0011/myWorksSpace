LeetCode 399: Evaluate Division

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where 
equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. 
Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where 
you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Example:
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], 
       queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
Explanation:
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]

Time Complexity: O(N + Q*V) where N is number of equations, Q is number of queries, V is number of variables
Space Complexity: O(V) where V is number of variables in equations
