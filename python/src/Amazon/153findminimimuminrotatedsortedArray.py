LeetCode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Problem Statement:
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
- [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times
- [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Constraints:
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times
