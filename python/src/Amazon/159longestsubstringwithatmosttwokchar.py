LeetCode 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

Problem Statement:
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of English letters
