LeetCode 994: Rotting Oranges

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- 0 representing an empty cell
- 1 representing a fresh orange
- 2 representing a rotten orange

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. 
If this is impossible, return -1.

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2
