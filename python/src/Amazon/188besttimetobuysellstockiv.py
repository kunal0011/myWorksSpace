LeetCode 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer k and an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the iáµ—Ê° day.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
- A transaction is a buy and a sell.
- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Constraints:
- 0 <= k <= 100
- 0 <= prices.length <= 1000
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
