LeetCode 133. Clone Graph

Problem Statement:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed).
For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on.
The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.
Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: 
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list [].
The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100]
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
- Node.val is unique for each node
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node
